# Before stage 1
					VROTBEK
All right, this is it. It's just you and me, Teef.

					TEEF
Is it really a good idea? We only ... there are too many enemies, is it even possible to stop?

					VROTBEK
Rox 'em. Those fuckers are taking our bones! Our BONES, Teef!
Those shlack won't get away with this.

					TEEF
Sigh ... With you I have seen all colors Vrotbek.

Good. Come on ... I follow you, but I have a blue fear of no return.

Uguã€œ


# Before boss
					BOSS
Bones, bones, bones!

					VROTBEK
(Some form of battlecry)

					BOSS
You're late! You leave me alone with these bones ... these beautiful bones!

					VROTBEK
The only bones left when we're done here will be YOURS, asshaver.

					BOSS
What? Your blitherings are meaningless.
Too many bones, too little time!

To inspire you ... here! My favorite discovery.
Dance, my disaster! Dance!


# After boss
					BOSS
This cannot be! Is it ... the end?

					TEEF
We will bury you with your bones.
This is the price of necromastery.

					VROTBEK
Leave him. That antelope is only the start...
Before this day is out they will tremble before me!
Do you hear me, cowardly necromasters? I am coming for you!
Who dies first?!
